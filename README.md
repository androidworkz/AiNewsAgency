I am new to github after nearly 30 years of being a developer. When I stoped writing code in 2016 to focus on an executive career, I was using SVN. Please excuse the fact that I committed to the wrong branch. 

Project is in the [Master Branch](https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/AiNewsAgency/tree/master)
