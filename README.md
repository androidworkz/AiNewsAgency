I am new to GitHub after nearly 30 years as a developer. When I stopped writing code in 2016 to focus on an executive career, I used SVN. Please excuse the fact that I committed to the wrong branch. 

The project is in the [Master Branch](https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/AiNewsAgency/tree/master)
